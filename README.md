# üïπÔ∏è Java Games from 2014

Welcome to this repository! It serves as a time capsule, holding some of the first game projects I ever developed in Java.

### The Origin Story

These games were created in 2015 when I was just 11 years old. They are the practical result of what I learned in the Danki Code game development course, which was my first deep dive into programming and the logic needed to create something interactive.

The main goal at the time was simply to learn and put the concepts I was taught into practice.

### The Projects

Inside this repository, you will find:

* **Mario:** A simple recreation inspired by the universe of the classic.
* **Minecraft_fake:** A basic 2D version inspired by Minecraft's building mechanics.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è A Friendly Warning

As these projects were developed by a beginner many years ago, the code does not reflect modern-day software development best practices. The main value of this repository is historical and sentimental, marking the beginning of a journey into the world of technology.

Thanks for visiting!
